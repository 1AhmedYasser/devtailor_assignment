### A Quick Walkthrough In The App

In this project i focused on making a clear architcture and to maintain a clear visablity on what each class do in the app

This App Contains:
1) Constants Seperation (Which makes it easier to change a text in the app or localize the entire app later)
2) Import utilization (To Avoid Huge blocks of imports)
3) Clear Directories Names and archtiecture (Which Makes it easy to navigate in the app)
4) Adding App Icon and App Splash To Make the app look more cool
5) Responsivness on different screen sizes on iOS and Android
6) Custom (NotoSans) Font (Which is added in the figma design to make the design look as close and possible to the required one)

Quick Notes:
1) I Added An Apk for android And an ipa for iOS in case you had any trouble running the app, you can then use them to run the app on your desired platform.
2) I Also Uploaded The iOS iPA on Diawi for a quick installation (https://webapp.diawi.com/install/xVy4V6). If You Which to test the app from test flight please contact me.
